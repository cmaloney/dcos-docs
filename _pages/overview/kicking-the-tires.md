If you've already read through the other [Overview][1] topics and you're looking to get some more hands on experience, the next step is to spin up a cluster.

The best way to try DCOS for yourself is to [install the DCOS Community Edition][2] on your favorite cloud provider.

Once you've got DCOS installed, you'll probably want to explore its [Web Interface][3].

If you're savvy with a terminal, you might also want to grab the [DCOS CLI][4].

Now what can you do with your very own DCOS cluster?

First, take a look at the [package repository][5] and install you favorite [services][6] with ease.

And if you want a more curated experience, choose one of our [tutorials][7] to follow.

Then, when you've got the basics down, read more about [developing your own services]]8].

To really go the distance, peruse the docs on how to [administer a DCOS installation][9].

Enjoy!
