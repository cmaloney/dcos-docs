If you've read through the other [overview][1] topics and you want some hands-on experience, the next step is to spin up a DCOS cluster for yourself.

# Install DCOS

The best way to try out DCOS is to [install the Community Edition][2] on your favorite cloud provider.

Once you've got DCOS installed, explore the [Web Interface][3].

If you're savvy with a terminal, you might also want to play around with the [DCOS CLI][4].

# What Can I Do With It?

First, take a look at the [package repository][5] and install you favorite [services][6] with ease.

For a more curated experience, follow one of our [tutorials][7].

# Go The Distance

When you've got the basics down, read more about [developing your own services][8].

Then continue down the road to mastery by perusing the docs on how to [administer a DCOS installation][9].

Enjoy!
