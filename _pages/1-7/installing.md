The DC/OS Community Edition (CE) is available to try for free on supported cloud providers by using DC/OS cloud templates. The templates are a JSON-formatted text file that describes the resources and properties.

The DC/OS Enterprise Edition (EE) provides everything you need to run DC/OS at scale in production. You can run on premise, in a cloud environment, or in a hybrid environment using both cloud and on premise infrastructure.
