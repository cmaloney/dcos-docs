# Local Installation

For first-time users or developers looking to build services or modify DC/OS, the Vagrant installer provides a quick, free way to deploy a virtual cluster on a single machine. For more information, see the [dcos.io][1] documentation.

# Cloud Provisioning

For users deploying to the public cloud, DC/OS offers configurable cloud provisioning templates for AWS and Azure that manage a DC/OS installation on virtual machines. For more information, see the [dcos.io][2] documentation.

# Enterprise Installation

The DC/OS Enterprise Edition (EE) provides everything you need to run DC/OS at scale in production. You can run on premise, in a cloud environment, or in a hybrid environment using both cloud and on premise infrastructure.

For non-Enterprise DC/OS installations, see the [dcos.io][3] documentation.
