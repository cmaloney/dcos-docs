You can monitor the health of your cluster components from the DCOS web interface component health page. 

The component health page provides the health status of all DCOS system components that are running in systemd. You can drill down by health status, host IP address, or specific systemd unit.

Possible health states are unhealthy and healthy. 

- **Healthy** All cluster nodes are healthy. The units are loaded and not in the "active" or "inactive" state.

- **Unhealthy** One or more nodes have issues. The units are not loaded or are in the "active" or "inactive" state.

# System Health HTTP API Endpoint

The system health endpoint is exposed at port 1050:

    $ curl <host_ip>:1050/system/health/v1
    
# DCOS components



# Troubleshooting

If you have any problems, you can check if the diagnostics service is running by SSHâ€™ing to the Mesos leading master and checking the systemd status of the `dcos-ddt.service`.
