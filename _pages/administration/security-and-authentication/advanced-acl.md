You can define fine-grained access to applications that are running in DCOS by defining advanced ACL groups. Advanced ACL groups can provide multi-tenancy by isolating application teams, and individual users. You can also control customized access to applications, for example read-only access. This access is administered on the backend by Admin Router and the native Marathon instance.

Authorization is not secure, but provides user isolation. Anything running inside the cluster, and anyone SSHâ€™d into it, has access to everything.

By default, when you install a DCOS service, an entry is created in the ACL for that particular service. For example, when you install Kafka, this ACL entry is created: `dcos:adminrouter:service:kafka`.
    

You can create advanced ACL groups for each role in your organization. 

To create an advanced ACL group:

1.  Launch the DCOS web interface and login with your Admin username and password.

2.  Click on the **System** tab, select **Organization**, and then **Groups**.

3.  Click **New Group** button and provide a name for your group.

4.  Open the new group and click **Advanced ACLs**.

5.  Define your advanced ACL by providing Resource and Permission and then click **Add Rule**.

    Here are the available resource options.
