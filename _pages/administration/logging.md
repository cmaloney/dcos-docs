DC/OS cluster nodes generate logs that contain diagnostic and status information for DC/OS core components and DC/OS services.

You can aggregate DC/OS logs using your existing log infrastructure. This section explains how to view DC/OS system and service logs, and how to manage DC/OS logs with ELK and Splunk.
