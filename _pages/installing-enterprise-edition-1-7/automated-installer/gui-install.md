The automated GUI installation method provides a simple graphical interface that guides you through the installation of DCOS. The automated installer provides a basic installation that is suitable for demonstrations and POCs. Only a subset of the configuration options are available with the GUI method. This is the fastest way to get started with DCOS.


# Install DCOS 

1.  From your terminal, start the DCOS GUI installer with this command.
    
        $ sudo bash dcos_generate_config.ee.sh --web
        
    
    Here is an example of the output.
    
        Running mesosphere/dcos-genconf docker with BUILD_DIR set to /home/centos/genconf
        16:36:09 dcos_installer.action_lib.prettyprint:: ====> Starting DCOS installer in web mode
        16:36:09 root:: Starting server ('0.0.0.0', 9000)
        
    
    **Tip:** You can add the verbose (`-v`) flag to see the debug output:
    
        $ sudo bash dcos_generate_config.ee.sh --web -v
        

2.  Launch the DCOS web installer in your browser at: `http://<bootstrap-node-public-ip>:9000`.

3.  Click **Begin Installation**.

4.  Specify your Deployment and DCOS Environment settings:
    
    ### Deployment Settings
    
    **Master Private IP List**
    :   Specify a comma-separated list of your internal static master IP addresses.
    
    **Agent Private IP List**
    :   Specify a comma-separated list of your internal static agent IP addresses.
    
    **Master Public IP**
    :   Specify a publicly accessible proxy IP address to one of your master nodes. If you don't have a proxy or already have access to the network where you are deploying this cluster, you can use one of the master IP's that you specified in the master list. This proxy IP address is used to access the DCOS web interface on the master node after DCOS is installed.
    
    **SSH Username**
    :   Specify the SSH username, for example `centos`. SSH Listening Port
    
    **SSH Listening Port**
    :   Specify the port to SSH to, for example `22`. SSH Key
    
    **SSH Key**
    :   Specify the private SSH key with access to your master IPs.
    
    ### DCOS Environment Settings
    
    **Username**
    :   Specify the administrator username. This username is required for using DCOS. This feature is only available in Enterprise Edition.
    
    **Password**
    :   Specify the administrator password. This password is required for using DCOS. This feature is only available in Enterprise Edition.
    
    **Upstream DNS Servers**
    
    :   Specify a comma-separated list of DNS resolvers for your DCOS cluster nodes. Set this parameter to the most authoritative nameservers that you have. If you want to resolve internal hostnames, set it to a nameserver that can resolve them. If you have no internal hostnames to resolve, you can set this to a public nameserver like Google or AWS. In the example file above, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using" target="_blank">Google Public DNS IP addresses (IPv4)</a> are specified (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`).
        
        *Caution:* If you set this parameter incorrectly you will have to reinstall DCOS. For more information about service discovery, see this [documentation][1].
    
    **IP Detect Script**
    
    :   Choose an IP detect script from the dropdown to broadcast the IP address of each node across the cluster. Each node in a DCOS cluster has a unique IP address that is used to communicate between nodes in the cluster. The IP detect script prints the unique IPv4 address of a node to STDOUT each time DCOS is started on the node.
        
        **Important:** The IP address of a node must not change after DCOS is installed on the node. For example, the IP address must not change when a node is rebooted or if the DHCP lease is renewed. If the IP address of a node does change, the node must be wiped and reinstalled.

5.  Click **Run Pre-Flight**. The preflight script installs the cluster prerequisites and validates that your cluster is installable. For a list of cluster prerequisites, see the scripted installer [prerequisites](/scripted-installer/system-requirements/#scrollNav-2). This step can take up to 15 minutes to complete. If errors any errors are found, fix and then click **Retry**.

    **Important:** If you exit your GUI installation before launching DCOS, you must do this before reinstalling:
    
        *   SSH to each node in your cluster and run `rm -rf /opt/mesosphere`.
        *   SSH to your bootstrap master node and run `rm -rf /var/lib/zookeeper`
        

6.  Click **Deploy** to install DCOS on your cluster. If errors any errors are found, fix and then click **Retry**.
    
    ![alt text](/assets/images/ui-installer-deploy1.png)
    
    **Tip:** This step might take a few minutes, depending on the size of your cluster.

7.  Click **Run Post-Flight**. If errors any errors are found, fix and then click **Retry**.
    
    ![alt text](/assets/images/ui-installer-post-flight1.png)
    
    **Tip:** You can click **Download Logs** to view your logs locally.

8.  Click **Log In To DCOS**.

9.  Enter your administrator username and password.

    You are done!

## Next Steps

Now you can [assign user roles][3].

### Uninstalling DCOS

1.  From the bootstrap node, enter this command:

        $ sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh --uninstall
        Running mesosphere/dcos-genconf docker with BUILD_DIR set to /home/centos/genconf
        ====> EXECUTING UNINSTALL
        This will uninstall DCOS on your cluster. You may need to manually remove /var/lib/zookeeper in some cases after this completes, please see our documentation for details. Are you ABSOLUTELY sure you want to proceed? [ (y)es/(n)o ]: yes
        ====> START uninstall_dcos
        ====> STAGE uninstall
        ====> STAGE uninstall
        ====> OUTPUT FOR uninstall_dcos
        ====> END uninstall_dcos with returncode: 0
        ====> SUMMARY FOR uninstall_dcos
        2 out of 2 hosts successfully completed uninstall_dcos stage.
        ====> END OF SUMMARY FOR uninstall_dcos
