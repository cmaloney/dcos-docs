DCOS is installed in your environment by using a dynamically generated setup file. This file is generated by using specific parameters that are set during configuration. This installation file contains a Bash install script and a Docker container that is loaded with everything you need to deploy a customized DCOS build.

The DCOS installation process requires a cluster of nodes to install DCOS onto and a single node to run the DCOS installation from.

You can use the automated installer or manual installer.

#### Automated installer

The automated installer provides a simple graphical interface that guides you through the installation of DCOS. The automated installer provides a basic installation that is suitable for demonstrations and POCs. This is the fastest way to get started with DCOS.

#### Manual installer

With the manual installer, you package the DCOS distribution yourself and connect to every node manually to run the DCOS installation commands. This installation method is recommended if you want to integrate with an existing system or if you donâ€™t have SSH access to your cluster.
