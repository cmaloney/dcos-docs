To install DCOS you can use the automated installer or manual installer.

#### Automated installer

The automated installer provides a simple graphical interface that guides you through the installation of DCOS. The automated installer provides a basic installation that is suitable for demonstrations and POCs. This is the fastest way to get started with DCOS.

#### Manual installer

With the manual installer, you package the DCOS distribution yourself and connect to every node manually to run the DCOS installation commands. This installation method is recommended if you want to integrate with an existing system or if you donâ€™t have SSH access to your cluster.
