DC/OS services are Marathon applications that are packaged and available from the public [DC/OS package repositories][1]. Available DC/OS services include Mesos frameworks and other applications. A [Mesos framework][2] is the combination of a Mesos scheduler and an optional custom executor.

DC/OS services are created by the community and by Mesosphere. The Mesosphere-maintained applications are: Cassandra, Chronos, HDFS, Jenkins, Kafka, Kubernetes, Marathon, Spark, and Velocity.
