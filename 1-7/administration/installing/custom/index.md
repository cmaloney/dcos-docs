Enterprise DC/OS is installed in your environment by using a dynamically generated setup file. This file is generated by using specific parameters that are set during configuration. This installation file contains a Bash install script and a Docker container that is loaded with everything you need to deploy a customized DC/OS build.

You can use the automated GUI or CLI installer, or advanced installer.

*   The automated GUI or CLI installer is optimized for new users who are installing to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premises, or in the cloud. The automated installer provides a guided experience for bootstrapping a DC/OS cluster.
*   The advanced installer is optimized for installing DC/OS to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premises or in the cloud. The advanced installer provides a scriptable, automatable interface to integrate with your preferred configuration management system.
